In this project we try to estimate the price of different properties in bangalore located across various locations in the city.We have taken our dataset from kaggle which is publicly available.Initially we have pre processed the data by taking care of missing values .We have also dropped the irrelavent columns that do not contribute to estimating the price of the properties.We have tried to remove most of the outliers(Extreme or exceptional values) that could have hindered our algorithms.At last our model is able to predict the prices of different properties with an accuracy of 80%.
